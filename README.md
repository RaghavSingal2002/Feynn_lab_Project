**AI Product Service Prototype Development and Business/Financial Modelling**
The document details market segmentation analysis
using the Australian vacation activities dataset to create
targeted marketing strategies. It employs biclustering to
identify key tourist segments, focusing on segment 3.
This segment, characterized by a preference for cultural
activities and higher vacation expenditures, informs
three key marketing mix elements.
1. Price: Segment 3's higher spending justifies premium
pricing for tailored products like "MUSEUMS,
MONUMENTS & MUCH, MUCH MORE."
2. Place: Emphasizes the need for online booking
options, reflecting Segment 3's preference for
booking accommodations online.
3. Promotion: Utilizes data on preferred information
sources and TV channels, suggesting that targeted
promotions should include information packs at
tourist centers and advertisements on Channel 7.
The document illustrates how precise market
segmentation can refine marketing efforts, ensuring
products meet the specific needs and preferences of
distinct consumer groups.
